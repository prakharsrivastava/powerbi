I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to inquire about the policy regarding laser treatment at your esteemed company, specifically whether it is covered under our health insurance plan.

Additionally, I would like to understand if the laser treatment procedure is cashless or if there is a copayment involved. Could you please provide me with details regarding any out-of-pocket expenses or copayments associated with laser treatments?

Furthermore, I recently incurred expenses for a dental procedure and would like to understand the process for submitting a claim. Could you please guide me through the necessary steps to file a claim for dental bills?

Your assistance in clarifying these matters would be greatly appreciated. If there are any forms or documentation required to process these inquiries, please do not hesitate to let me know.

Thank you very much for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response.

Warm regards,
