 hope this message finds you well. I am writing to inform you that there is an issue with the loan certificate related to the amount, which is currently being resolved. Unfortunately, due to some network issues from the bankâ€™s side, the necessary updates are taking longer than expected.

I have been following up with the bank for the past few weeks, and I am actively working to resolve the matter as quickly as possible. As such, I kindly request an extension of a few more days to submit the corrected loan certificate.

Please note that I have already submitted all the other required proofs as requested.

Thank you for your understanding and consideration. I apologize for any inconvenience caused and appreciate your patience.
