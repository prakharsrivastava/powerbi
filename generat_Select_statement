Subject: Inquiry Regarding Health Insurance Policy and Coverage Details

Dear [Insurance Representative's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. My name is Vanishree, and I am writing to inquire about the details of my health insurance policy and additional coverage options. Please find below the specifics of my queries:

Existing Policy Claim and Copay:

My existing policy has no room limit. I intend to claim an amount of ₹30,000 from my existing policy and the remaining amount from my new policy.
Could you confirm if there will be any copay involved or any potential issues while claiming the amount of ₹30,000?
Accidental Cover:

Is accidental cover included in my current policy? If so, how much is covered?
Invoice for Earlier Claim:

I have previously shared the invoice for an earlier claim. Could you confirm the status of that claim?
Lasik Surgery Coverage:

My vision power is high, and I am considering lasik surgery. Could you recommend a plan that covers lasik surgery?
Additionally, what plans cover OPD and routine body check-ups?
Premium for Additional Coverage:

Could you confirm the premium if I wish to include dental and laser treatments in my policy?
If I add dependents (spouse and daughter), will they be covered, and what will be the ratio of coverage?
How soon will the claim amount be replenished if exhausted?
Impact on Premium:

Will my premium increase if I add my spouse to the policy? How will the claims be distributed?
Will the premium remain the same with each passing year?
No Claim Bonus:

What is the no claim bonus for my policy?
Future Coverage for Dependents:

If I add my spouse and daughter in the future, will they be covered under the same policy?
I appreciate your assistance in addressing these queries. Please provide detailed information on the above points so that I can make informed decisions regarding my health insurance coverage.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

Best regards,
